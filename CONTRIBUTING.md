- Potential implementation ideas (if any).

### Code Contributions

If you're looking to dive into the code:

1. Browse the [issues](https://github.com/topworklytechnologies/go-microx/issues) for any tasks labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
2. Comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it.
3. If it's a new feature, please open an issue first to discuss the design before starting work.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: v1.22 or higher.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Make**: For running project commands (optional but recommended).

### Local Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-microx.git
   cd go-microx
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/topworklytechnologies/go-microx.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-name
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code satisfies the **Coding Standards**.
2. Update the `README.md` or `docs/` if you've added new features or changed behaviors.
3. Verify that all tests pass: `go test ./...`.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/topworklytechnologies/go-microx/pulls) against the `main` branch.
6. A maintainer will review your PR. Be prepared to address feedback!

## Commit Message Guidelines

We prefer clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` for new features.
- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `docs:` for documentation changes.
- `style:` for formatting/styling (no logic changes).
- `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test:` for adding or updating tests.
- `chore:` for updating build tasks, dependencies, etc.
