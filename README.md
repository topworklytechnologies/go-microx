go-microx new
```

### Interactive Flow Details

The CLI handles the heavy lifting, prompting you for:

1. **Template Selection:** Industry-specific architecture patterns.
2. **Project Naming:** Your unique service identifier.
3. **HTTP Router:** Gin, Fiber, Chi, Echo, or Standard Mux.
4. **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, or None.
5. **Authentication:** Secure your services from the start.
